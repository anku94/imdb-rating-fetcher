IMDB Rating Fetcher
===================

Recursively fetches all movie titles in a given folder and prints ratings for all found movie titles

Does not support TV shows yet. Might work incorrectly if given folder has TV shows mixed with movies.

Install dependencies first:

sudo pip install imdbpy
sudo pip install progressbar

Run as:

python rate.py /path/to/movies/folder
